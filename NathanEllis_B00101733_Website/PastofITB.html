	<p> ITB was first built in 1999, the Institute was originally meant to be in Navan but IBM influenced the decision to be built in Blanchardstown, to drum up more employent.</p>
		
	<p>The instittue was meant to be  near the shopping centre, though its current location was chosen instead.When it first opened its doors, there were only three courses available! Which were: Electronic and Computer Engineering, Buissness Studies and Computing in IT.</p>
		
	<p>Rumour has it that the cement wasnt even fully dry when the college first opened. At the time, the only Building at the time was A-block. </p>
	
	<p> In 2004 the institute was officially Launched.</p>
	
	<p> In 2006 the ITB logo got updated to the current version, as the older verison was hard to work with. </p>
	
	<p> In 2009, ITB celebrated its 10th anniversary by having a comunity day with 10 year old school students as ITB was 10 aswell. Also a staff reunion was held.</p>
