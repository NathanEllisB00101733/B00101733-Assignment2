<p> On the 17th of July 2018, TU Dublin was founded. A bill was passed allowing 3 institutes of technology to merge in ireland. They were ITB, Tallaght and DIT. On January 2019, TU Dublin will be established. In 2014 ITB, DIT an ITT all joined to enter into a process that would help merge all 3 institutes merge into a university.

There was a bid proposed by the three IT's called The Dublin bid. In 2014 this became a bid from the 3 IT's to become a technological university. The project name was "Technological University for Dublin". In April 2018 the 3 IT's sent in a final appilcation.  President Michael D. Higgins signed the the "Technological Universities Act 2018" into law, so this became a good time to put foward the fianl application for TU Dublin.

This mean TU Dublin was founded in July 2018 and the new institute will be established on January 2019.</p>
